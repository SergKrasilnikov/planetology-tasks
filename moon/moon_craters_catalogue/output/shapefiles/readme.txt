Lunar Global Crater Catalog LU1319381 (Diameter â‰¥1 km) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of the fields:
ID: Unified identification of the crater
Longitude and Latitude: Geographic coordinates of the crater center in decimal degrees
Diameter: The diameter of the crater in meters
Depth: The depth of the crater in meters, as measured from global lunar DEMs (Barker et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2010)
Source: Source information of the crater 
           0: The entry is from this catalog (Wang, Wu, et al., 2020)
           1: The entry is transferred from Robbins (2018) with a rim-fitting process
           2: The entry is transferred from Head et al. (2010) with a rim-fitting process 
Source_lon, Soure_lat, Source_dia: The original geographic coordinates and diameters of craters in Robbins (2018) if the "Source" is 1, and in Head et al. (2010) if the "Source" is 2. For the entries from this catalog, these fields are marked as 0.
